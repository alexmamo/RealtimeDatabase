# RealtimeDatabase - Clean Architecture with MVVM.

It's an aplication build with Kotlin as an example on how to display data from a [Fireabse Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), using three different approaches. The first approach is using a callback, the second approach is using an [Android Architecture Component](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) called [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata), and the third one is using [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html).

To keep things simple, the app uses a very simple database schema that look like in the image below:

The app uses also the [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel).

To make this app work, follow the instructions given in the official documentation regarding [how to add Firebase to your project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup). Add the JSON file in your app folder, add some dummy products and see it working.

This repo is the source code of the this article: [How to read data from Firebase Realtime Database usingÂ get()?](...)
